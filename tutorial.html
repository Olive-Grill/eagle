Eaglercraft 1.8.8 is a copy of Minecraft 1.8.8 ported to HTML

This is a tutorial about how to use Eaglercraft on eagle-plum.vercel.app

SECTION 1. SINGLEPLAYER
	Works same as Minecraft singleplayer
    If you have never played Minecraft before, I suggest searching for a "Minecraft 1.8" tutorial

SECTION 2. MULTIPLAYER   

- In Eaglercraft you can play multiplayer locally or through an online server
    
    a. LOCAL PLAY
    	Even though this is multiplayer, you must go into the singleplayer tab to locally play.
        
        1. SETTING UP LOCAL WORLD
        - First, one person needs to create a world, then they need to press "esc" to see the menu.
        - Once at the menu, the world creator must click "Invite"
        - Hit continue and edit any world settings if you want.
        - Click "Start shared world"
        - Note the "Relay URL" and "Join Code," these will be important.
        
        2. JOINING LOCAL WORLD
        - When joining, the other player(s) must first go to the "Multiplayer" section from the home page.
        - Next, click "Network Settings"
        - Click the Relay URL (example: "wss://lax1dude.net") mentioned before, and click "Set Primary" at 			  the bottom
          	- If the Primary URL is already correct, don't change.
		- Click "Done", "Cancel", then "Singleplayer"
        - Click "Join Shared World" and enter code.

	b. Online Servers
    	
        1. Background (READ BEFORE CLICKING PLAY)
        	- If you may want to play with other people around the world, this is the section you want to go 			   to.
        	- Most Servers use a Username and Password system
            - REMEMBER THE USERNAME AND PASSWORD YOU USED WHEN REGISTERING
        	- Some usernames may already be registered to the server, so use a unique username when first 	               logging onto Eaglercraft
		2. Adding Servers
        	- Once you have selected a unique name, and are on the main menu go to "Multiplayer"
            - Press "Add Server"
            - Type in a server address in its box. The format is "wss://example.com" (Must start with wss://)
             	- Here are some examples that work:
            		- ArchMC - "wss://mc.arch.lol"
                	- Rice Network - "wss://mc.ricenetwork.xyz"
                	- Vanilla MC - "wss://vanillamc.me"
                    - Clever Teaching - "wss://clever-teaching.com"
                    - Time Legacy - "wss://mc.time-legacy.net"
			- You can give the server any name, only the address matters
            - Press done then click the server and "Join Server"
		3. Playing in the server
            - In the server, you will likely be asked to type "/register [password] [password again]"
            	- Occasionally, it may be the case that someone else has registered your username again
                - In this case go back to the main menu and click "edit profile" and change your username
                - Try to register again
            - This will be the password associated with you username
            - On future logins, you will be asked to type "/login [password]
            - You must have the SAME USERNAME TO LOGIN

SECTION 3 (KEY POINTS)

WORLDS MAY BE DELETED IF COOKIES ARE CLEARED

WRITE DOWN YOUR USERNAME AND PASSWORD FOR SERVERS ON A GOOGLE DOC, I RECCOMEND USING THE SAME COMBINATION FOR ALL SERVERS
